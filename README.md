# Bucket Platformer

## Overview

I undertook this project to learn how to use the Python Arcade library to make a simple game.

This game is a prototype of a platformer game where a small robot can traverse an post-apocalyptic wasteland and shoot quadrupedal squid-like aliens. It's not done. The controls are:

* Left: A
* Right: D
* Jump: Space Bar
* Shoot: Enter Key

I wrote this game as an introduction to and demonstration of using the Python Arcade library.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}

## Development Environment

This project was written in Python using the VS Code editor. It uses the Python Arcade library. Tiled map editor was used to create the map and Pyxel Edit was used to create the tile sets and sprites. Tilesetter Lite was also used to create tile maps.

Python is a high level programming language that is dynamically typed, garbage collected and relies on and enforces indentation to signify code blocks.

* [Tiled Documentation](https://doc.mapeditor.org/en/stable/)

## Future Work

* Get the collisions working better.  The pymunk physics engine is doing weird stuff
* Add levels, more enemies, level starts and ends
* Add complexity to player sprite, more animations.
